final project for javascript class


In this website we used node.js to run a server off our computers to host a website that allows teachers to add and create classes for students to add to their schedule. 

Using node app.js in the main directory you will be sent to the index page where you can access the website.

registration page can be found at /register

1. added the ability to add users
2. added login/logout
3. added the ability to select roles for users
4. added the ability to add claasses
5. add the ability for teachers to create classes
6. made it so students cannot create classes
7. connected the server to a database using mongodb atlas

DIDNT DO
1.did not add a proper shopping cart
2.did not add class search

KNOW BUGS
